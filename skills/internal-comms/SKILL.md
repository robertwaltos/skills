## Communication Framework

### The SBAR Framework (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation)

For most internal communications:

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Situation** | Current state in one sentence | 1-2 sentences |
| **Background** | Context needed to understand | 2-4 sentences |
| **Assessment** | Analysis and implications | 2-4 sentences |
| **Recommendation** | Clear next steps or asks | 1-3 sentences |

### Audience-Aware Writing

| Audience | Optimize For | Avoid |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Executives | TL;DR first, key metrics, decisions needed | Excessive detail, jargon |
| Managers | Actionable items, timeline, dependencies | Vague asks, missing deadlines |
| Individual Contributors | Specific tasks, rationale, support | Corporate speak, unclear expectations |
| All-hands | Clarity, motivation, alignment | Inside jokes, assumptions of context |

---

## How to Use This Skill

To write any internal communication:

1. **Identify the communication type** from the request
2. **Load the appropriate guideline file** from the `examples/` directory:
    - `examples/3p-updates.md` - For Progress/Plans/Problems team updates
    - `examples/company-newsletter.md` - For company-wide newsletters
    - `examples/faq-answers.md` - For answering frequently asked questions
    - `examples/general-comms.md` - For anything else that doesn't explicitly match one of the above
3. **Follow the specific instructions** in that file for formatting, tone, and content gathering

If the communication type doesn't match any existing guideline, ask for clarification or more context about the desired format.

## Quality Principles

### Clarity First
- Lead with the most important information
- Use short sentences and paragraphs
- Avoid jargon unless audience is technical
- Include clear calls-to-action

### Appropriate Tone
| Context | Tone |
|---------|------|
| Good news | Celebratory but not over-the-top |
| Bad news | Direct, empathetic, solution-focused |
| Routine updates | Professional, concise |
| Urgent matters | Clear, action-oriented |
| Sensitive topics | Thoughtful, human, careful |

### Structure for Skimmability
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold for key terms
- Headers for sections
- TL;DR at top for longer communications

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Burying the lead**: Put conclusions first, not last
❌ **Wall of text**: Break up with structure and whitespace
❌ **Vague asks**: "Please review" → "Please approve by Friday"
❌ **Missing context**: Assume readers have less context than you think
❌ **Corporate jargon overload**: "Synergize" → "Work together"
❌ **Passive voice**: "Mistakes were made" → "We made mistakes"
