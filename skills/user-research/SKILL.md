## Analysis Frameworks

### Affinity Mapping Process

```markdown
## Affinity Mapping Steps

1. **Gather Data**
   - Export all notes, quotes, observations
   - One insight per sticky note (physical or Miro/FigJam)
   - Include participant ID for traceability

2. **Initial Clustering**
   - Silently group similar items
   - Don't name groups yet
   - Multiple researchers reduce bias

3. **Refine Groups**
   - Discuss and adjust groupings
   - Split large groups (>20 items)
   - Combine small groups (<3 items)

4. **Name Themes**
   - Create descriptive theme names
   - Themes should be insights, not topics
   - Bad: "Onboarding"
   - Good: "Users feel overwhelmed by initial setup complexity"

5. **Identify Hierarchies**
   - Group themes into higher-level categories
   - Create 4-8 major themes

6. **Prioritize**
   - Mark themes by frequency (how many mentioned)
   - Mark themes by intensity (strength of feeling)
   - Identify cross-cutting themes
```

### Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

```markdown
## JTBD Interview Structure

### Core Question Format

| **Pull** (toward new) | "What attracted you to this solution?" |
| **Anxiety** (fear of new) | "What concerns did you have about switching?" |
| **Habit** (comfort with old) | "What did you like about how you used to do it?" |

## Final Step: Impact Measurement

Research is only successful if it influences decisions. After each project:

1. **Track Decisions**: Document what decisions were made based on findings
2. **Measure Outcomes**: Follow up on implemented recommendations
3. **Build Credibility**: Share impact stories with stakeholders
4. **Improve Process**: Retrospect on what worked and what didn't

The research is complete when insights have been communicated, decisions have been influenced, and the knowledge is preserved for future reference.
